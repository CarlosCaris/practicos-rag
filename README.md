# Building an End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

Welcome to the **Building an End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation System** repository. This repository is designed to guide you through the process of creating a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch, following a structured curriculum.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the course:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarlosCaris/practicos-rag.git
2. Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
3. Activate the environment
   ```bash
    # On Mac
    .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Introduction

This repository contains the materials and code needed to build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. A RAG system combines the strengths of large language models with an external knowledge base to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated responses. Throughout this course, you'll gain hands-on experience with the various components of a RAG system, from document chunking to deployment in the cloud.
